# AI Prompt Guide for Overhaul Execution

Use these prompts with a high-capability AI (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, or Gemini 1.5 Pro) to transform your `index.html`.

## Phase 1: Layout & Visual Core
**Prompt:**
```markdown
Context: I am overhauling an existing index.html for "ChamaLead" (AI WhatsApp Automation).
Goal: Implement a "Magnetic UI" aesthetic using Tailwind CSS.
Action:
1. Refactor the Hero section to use a "Spotlight" effect that follows the mouse using CSS variables and a minimal JS mouse listener.
2. Replace static borders with "Perspective Dividers" and "Fade-out Masks" at the bottom of each section.
3. Implement a Bento Grid layout for the "Features" section with glassmorphism cards.
4. Ensure the iPhone mockup uses 3D tilt (CSS perspective) that reacts subtly to scroll.
Rules: Preserve the existing Lucide icons but add 'glow' effects to them.
```

## Phase 2: Copy & Psychological Triggers
**Prompt:**
```markdown
Context: I have an index.html and a Neuromarketing plan.
Goal: Rewrite the copy for 100% conversion magnetism.
Action:
1. Apply the "Framing Effect" to the headline: Focus on "What they are losing" without AI.
2. Implement "Social Proof Anchoring": Add a real-time (simulated) notification bubble saying "New Automation Deployed in [City]" every 30 seconds.
3. Enhance the Scarcity: Add a "Live Slots" counter that starts at 7 and drops to 3 during the session.
4. Micro-copy: Change all buttons from generic "Register" to high-intent "Claim My Machine".
```

## Phase 3: Performance & Polish
**Prompt:**
```markdown
Goal: 100/100 Lighthouse score and premium feel.
Action:
1. Defer non-critical CSS/JS.
2. Implement "Skeleton Loading" states for the dynamic WhatsApp mockup.
3. Add a "Scroll Progress Blur": As the user scrolls, the navbar adds a glass-blur effect only when they are not at the top.
4. Optimize SVGs and Lucide icon loading.
```
